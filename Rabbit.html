    <h1>Socks the Rabbit</h1>
    <p class="special-paragraph">My rabbit has the name of Socks because of his 4 white paws imposing as socks.</p>
    <p>He was found on the streets of Brooklyn by my friend. She could not take him in. Fortunately I was able to.</p>
    <p>During my free time, I love to accompany and play with Socks the Wabbit. I would have never thought that this pet would change my life. </p>
